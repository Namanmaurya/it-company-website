      <h2>HTML - HyperText Markup Language</h2>
      <p>
        HTML is the foundation of all websites. It defines the structure of web pages using a series of elements (or "tags").
        Elements like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> are used to define headers, paragraphs, and links.
        Every visible part of a web page is built using HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML is not a programming language; it's a markup language. It tells the browser what content to display and how it is organized.
        It includes attributes to provide additional information such as links, images, and styling hooks.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML5, the latest version, introduced semantic elements like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,
        making code more meaningful and accessible.

      <h2>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
      <p>
        CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed. It allows developers to apply styles like colors, fonts, spacing, and layout adjustments.
        You can apply CSS inline, internally (in the same HTML file), or externally (linked CSS file).
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS supports selectors, which let you apply styles to specific elements or groups of elements. It also supports classes and IDs for more control.
        For example, <code>.button</code> might style all buttons consistently, while <code>#main-banner</code> styles a specific section.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern CSS includes powerful layout tools such as Flexbox and Grid, which allow responsive and complex designs without needing JavaScript.
        Media queries help adapt your layout to different screen sizes for mobile-friendly design.

      <h2>JavaScript - The Language of the Web</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a versatile programming language that runs in the browser. It enables dynamic content—anything that changes without reloading the page.
        This includes things like form validation, animations, dropdowns, and AJAX requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript can manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), which represents the structure of your HTML. Using methods like
        <code>document.getElementById</code> or <code>querySelector</code>, you can update content, hide/show elements, or change styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is also the foundation for frontend frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, and Angular, which are used to build modern single-page applications (SPAs).
        ES6 and beyond introduced features like arrow functions, classes, promises, async/await, and modules for better code management.

      <h2>PHP - Server-Side Scripting Language</h2>
      <p>
        PHP is a widely-used open-source server-side scripting language designed for web development.
        It is executed on the server, and its output is sent to the client’s browser as plain HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        PHP is especially powerful for creating dynamic websites and handling forms, sessions, cookies, and interacting with databases like MySQL.
        For example, when you log in to a website or submit a form, PHP processes the data in the background.
      </p>
      <p>
        Popular platforms like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal are built with PHP. It integrates well with HTML and can embed server-side logic directly in HTML files.
        PHP also supports object-oriented programming and frameworks such as Laravel and CodeIgniter, which help build robust applications faster.
