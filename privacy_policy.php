                <h2>USER INFORMATION</h2>
                <p>To avail certain services on our Websites, users are required to provide certain information for the
                    registration process namely: - a) your name, b) email address, c) sex, d) age, e) PIN code, f)
                    credit card or debit card details g) medical records and history h) sexual orientation, i) biometric
                    information, j) password etc., and / or your occupation, interests, and the like. The Information as
                    supplied by the users enables us to improve our sites and provide you the most user-friendly
                    experience.</p>
                <p>All required information is service dependent and we may use the above said user information to,
                    maintain, protect, and improve its services (including advertising services) and for developing new
                    services</p>
                <p>Such information will not be considered as sensitive if it is freely available and accessible in the
                    public domain or is furnished under the Right to Information Act, 2005 or any other law for the time
                    being in force.</p>

                <h2>COOKIES</h2>
                <p>To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use "cookies", or similar electronic
                    tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification
                    (User ID) to understand the user's individual interests using the Identified Computer. Unless you
                    voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing
                    who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can
                    contain is information you supply (an example of this is when you ask for our Personalized form). A
                    cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to
                    your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not control.
                </p>
                <p>Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the
                    Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets
                    computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.)
                    Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages
                    to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our
                    site and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come.</p>

                <h2>INFORMATION SHARING</h2>
                <p>We shares the sensitive personal information to any third party without obtaining the prior consent
                    of the user in the following limited circumstances:
                </p>

                <p>(a) When it is requested or required by law or by any court or governmental agency or authority to
                    disclose, for verification of identity, or for the prevention, detection, investigation including
                    cyber incidents, or for prosecution and punishment of offences. These disclosures are made in good
                    faith and belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for enforcing these terms for
                    complying with the applicable laws and regulations.</p>

                <p>(b) We propose to share such information within its group companies and officers and employees of
                    such group companies for the purpose of processing personal information on its behalf. We also
                    ensure that these recipients of such information agree to process such information based on our
                    instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality
                    and security measures.</p>

                <h2>INFORMATION SECURITY</h2>
                <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized
                    alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data
                    collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption
                    and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store
                    personal data.</p>
                <p>All information gathered on our Website is securely stored within our controlled database. The
                    database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected
                    and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is
                    impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that
                    information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And,
                    of course, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone
                    with Internet access.
                </p>

                <p>However, the internet is an ever-evolving medium. We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time
                    to incorporate necessary future changes. Of course, our use of any information we gather will always
                    be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what the new
                    policy may be.</p>

                <h2>Grievance Redressal</h2>
                <p>Redressal Mechanism: Any complaints, abuse or concerns with regards to content and or comment or
                    breach of these terms shall be immediately informed to the designated Grievance Officer as mentioned
                    below via in writing or through email signed with the electronic signature to info@drabito.com
